# Fruits Classification Using CNN

### The Dataset
The dataset being used is a collection of high-quality images containing different fruits. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com and created by Horea Muresan and Mihai Oltean (citation below). The fruits used in the dataset were planted in the shaft of a low speed motor and a short video of 20 seconds was recorded to capture the images.


### Dataset Properties
Training set: 15506 images.

Testing set: 5195 images.

Number of classes: 33 fruits.

Image size: 100x100 pixels.

Filename format: image_index_100.jpg (e.g. 32_100.jpg) or r_image_index_100.jpg (e.g. r_32_100.jpg). "r" stands for rotated fruit. "100" represents image size (100x100 pixels).

Different varieties of the same fruit are shown having different labels (e.g. Apple Red 1, Apple Red 2).
